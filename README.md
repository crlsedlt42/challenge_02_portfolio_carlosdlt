# Challenge 02 - Portfolio

## Description

For this week's challenge I was tasked to create an HTML & CSS files that would build a portfolio for any future employer to view. Topics learned over the first two weeks of class were needed to complete this challenge.

In this challenge, no initial HTML or CSS files were available to refactor. This made the challenge interesting due to the fact that everything needed to created entirely from scratch. 

This week was difficult for me because I believed I was comfortable with CSS and styling but as I started inputing code to the CSS file, I had a hard time to get the website like I had envisioned.

I will have to review all CSS classes and class activities so that I can become comfortable and proficient enough to improve on this challenge.
