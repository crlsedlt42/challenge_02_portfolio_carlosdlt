<!--ADD INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF-->
            My name is Carlos Enrique De La Torre and I'm from Southern Arizona. I have an accumulation of 10 years in customer service and retail.
            Now I'm trying to branch out by attending a Coding Boot Camp, sponsored by ASU. The story about why I wanted to take this Boot Camp started back in 2020.
            Everyone was affected by COVID-19 pandemic because of the quarantine protocols that were placed internationally. During this time, people got very creative on ways to beat the quarantine.
            One magnificent way was to live out of a utility van and travel around their country (for a lucky few, other countries). This sparked a social media frenzy about people living in their vans.
            I wanted to jump on that bandwagon with urgency and excitement, but with declining health, limited funds, my in-person job, and not having a van this made my dream of traveling the country an impossible mission.
            Today, I chose to accept this "Mission Impossible" due to the fact that in April 12, 2023 I finally recieved a long awaited call from a hospital in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico telling me that a kidney donor was available.
            Thank God for answering the prayers of family, friends and even strangers I was a match to the upcoming donor and had my kidney transplant surgery with not a single complication. 
            With my health being better than ever before, one goal has been met to make my dream of traveling all 50 states a reality. 
            I believe that this Boot Camp will assist me in completing the other goals by working remotely and having funds to travel and finally buy a utility van.
